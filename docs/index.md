## Daily Schedule Format

Each day follows this structure:

### Morning Session (4 hours)

- Optional: Daily check-in with peers on Teams (15 min)
- Video Learning (60-120 min)
- Reference Material (30 min)
- Hands-on Coding - Part 1 (remainder)

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)

- Video Learning (30 min, if applicable)
- Hands-on Coding - Part 2 (3-3.5 hours)

### Reflection & Consolidation (30 min)

- Review key concepts
- Write daily reflection
- List questions for check-in

---

## How to Use These Materials

### Daily Workflow

1. **Read the Overview** - Start each week by reading the weekly overview
2. **Follow the Daily Plan** - Each day has a structured 8-hour schedule
3. **Watch Videos** - All video links are embedded with durations
4. **Complete Exercises** - Hands-on coding is essential for learning
5. **Daily Reflection** - Document your learning and questions
6. **Check-ins** - Monday, Wednesday, Friday with instructor

### Resources Needed

- Google Colab account (free)
- Stable internet connection
- 8 hours per day for focused learning
- Microsoft Teams for communication
- Notebook for reflections

---

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this program, you will be able to:

✅ Master Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch)  
✅ Implement ML algorithms from scratch  
✅ Build and train neural networks  
✅ Apply CNNs to image classification  
✅ Understand modern architectures (ResNet, Transformers, GANs)  
✅ Deploy models to production  
✅ Practice ethical AI development  
✅ Complete end-to-end ML projects  

---

## Support & Communication

- **Microsoft Teams**: Group for questions and peer support
- **Check-ins**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (approximately 1 hour each)
- **Email**: For individual concerns
- **Peer Learning**: Collaborate and learn from classmates

---

## Tips for Success

- **Watch all video tutorials** completely before starting exercises
- **Type code, don't copy** - Understanding comes from doing. Except for print statements, plotting statements etc I recommend that you should write out every line of code, unless you understand it completely.
- **Complete all reflections** - They consolidate learning
- **Form study groups** - Learn together on Teams. Feel free to compare your solutions with peers to learn different approaches
- **Portfolio** - feel free to consolidate all the code as a basic portfolio of your work, to which you can add and contribute as you grow in Machine Learning.

# Week 5 Overview: Capstone Project Development

## Introduction

Week 5 is dedicated to building your capstone project - a complete machine learning system that demonstrates everything you've learned. You'll choose a project track, develop your solution iteratively, and present a portfolio-ready project. This week emphasizes independent work with structured guidance and checkpoints.

## Week Goals

* Plan and scope a realistic ML project with clear success criteria
* Build a complete end-to-end ML pipeline from data to evaluation
* Apply techniques from Weeks 1-4 to a real problem
* Debug and iterate on model performance systematically
* Document your work professionally for your portfolio
* Present your project and results confidently

## Weekly Structure

* Day 21: Project Planning & Setup - Choose track, define scope, explore data
* Day 22: Data Pipeline & Baseline Model - Preprocessing, simple model, initial results
* Day 23: Model Development & Iteration - Advanced architectures, experimentation
* Day 24: Testing & Refinement - Comprehensive evaluation, optimization, edge cases
* Day 25: Documentation & Presentation - Polish code, create README, present project

## Project Tracks

Choose one track or propose your own (with instructor approval):

**Track 1: Computer Vision** - Image classification on domain-specific dataset
**Track 2: Natural Language Processing** - Text classification with modern techniques  
**Track 3: Time Series Forecasting** - Sequential prediction on real-world data

Each track includes suggested datasets, architecture recommendations, and success criteria.

## Success Criteria

Your project should demonstrate:
- Clean, well-organized code structure
- Proper train/validation/test splits
- Model achieving reasonable performance (>80% accuracy or appropriate metric)
- Comprehensive evaluation with visualizations
- Professional documentation (README with results)
- Working code that runs without errors

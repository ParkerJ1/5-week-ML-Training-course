# Week 1 Overview: Python & ML Fundamentals

## Introduction

Week 1 establishes the foundation for your machine learning journey. You will master essential Python libraries, understand fundamental ML concepts, and complete your first end-to-end machine learning project.

## Week Goals

- Master NumPy for numerical computing and array operations
- Learn Matplotlib for data visualization and result presentation
- Understand core ML concepts: supervised learning, train/val/test splits, overfitting
- Implement linear regression and logistic classification from scratch
- Use scikit-learn for practical machine learning workflows
- Complete Titanic survival prediction project

## Weekly Structure

- **Day 1**: Python Crash Course - NumPy & Arrays
- **Day 2**: Python Crash Course - Matplotlib & Data Visualization
- **Day 3**: Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts
- **Day 4**: Classification and Logistic Regression
- **Day 5**: Scikit-learn Ecosystem and Mini-Project

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of Week 1, you will be able to:

- Manipulate multi-dimensional arrays efficiently using NumPy
- Create professional visualizations to communicate insights
- Explain the difference between training, validation, and test sets
- Implement gradient descent and understand how models learn
- Evaluate classification models using appropriate metrics
- Build complete ML pipelines using scikit-learn
- Work independently on structured ML projects

## Tips for Success

To get the most out of Week 1:

- Watch all video tutorials completely before starting exercises
- Type out code examples rather than copying and pasting - except for print statements, plotting statements etc I recommend that you should write out every line of code, unless you understand it completely.
- Complete daily reflections - they help consolidate learning
- Ask questions during check-ins if concepts are unclear
- Compare your solutions with peers to learn different approaches

## Daily Schedule Format

Each day follows this structure:

### Morning Session (4 hours)

- Optional: Daily check-in with peers on Teams (15 min)
- Video Learning (60-120 min)
- Reference Material (30 min)
- Hands-on Coding - Part 1 (remainder)

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)

- Video Learning (30 min, if applicable)
- Hands-on Coding - Part 2 (3-3.5 hours)

### Reflection & Consolidation (30 min)

- Review key concepts
- Write daily reflection
- List questions for check-in

## Assessment

As long as you demonstrate a bona fide effort in completing exercises and projects, you will receive credit for the vac work. Focus on learning rather than perfection.

## Communication

- **Microsoft Teams**: Use the group for questions, discussions, and peer support
- **Check-ins**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (approximately 1 hour each)
- **Email**: For individual questions or concerns

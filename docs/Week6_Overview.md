# Week 6 Overview: Production Machine Learning (OPTIONAL)

## Introduction

Week 6 is an optional extension for students who want to learn production ML deployment. This week covers model optimization, API development, MLOps practices, and professional software engineering for ML. Consider this week if you plan to deploy ML systems in production environments.

## Week Goals

* Optimize models for production (quantization, pruning, ONNX export)
* Deploy models as REST APIs using FastAPI and Docker
* Apply MLOps fundamentals (experiment tracking, model versioning, monitoring)
* Write production-quality code with testing and documentation
* Build and deploy a complete production ML system
* Understand the full ML lifecycle from training to deployment

## Weekly Structure

* Day 26: Model Optimization - Quantization, Pruning, ONNX
* Day 27: Model Deployment - FastAPI, Docker, Cloud Platforms
* Day 28: MLOps Fundamentals - Experiment Tracking, Versioning, Pipelines
* Day 29: Best Practices - Testing, Documentation, Code Quality
* Day 30: Production Project - Deploy Your Week 5 Project

## Prerequisites

This is an **advanced optional week**. You should have:
- Completed Weeks 1-5 successfully
- Working ML project from Week 5
- Strong Python skills
- Basic familiarity with command line
- Interest in production ML engineering

## Who Should Take This Week

This week is ideal if you:
- Want to become an ML Engineer (not just data scientist)
- Plan to deploy models in production
- Are interested in MLOps and DevOps
- Want to build end-to-end ML systems
- Aim for industry ML roles

## Who Can Skip This Week

You can skip this week if you:
- Are focused purely on research/academia
- Prefer exploratory data science roles
- Want to move on to other ML topics
- Are time-constrained

## Success Criteria

By the end of Week 6, you should have:
- Optimized ML model (4x smaller, faster inference)
- Working REST API serving predictions
- Dockerized application
- Monitoring dashboard
- Production-ready code with tests
- Deployed system accessible via URL

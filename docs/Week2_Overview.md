# Week 2 Overview: Neural Networks Foundations

## Introduction

Week 2 introduces neural networks - the foundation of modern deep learning. You'll understand how neural networks work from first principles, implement them from scratch, then master PyTorch to build production-ready models.

## Week Goals

- Understand neural network architecture and forward propagation
- Master backpropagation and the chain rule
- Implement neural networks from scratch in NumPy
- Learn PyTorch fundamentals (tensors, autograd, nn.Module)
- Apply regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization)
- Complete MNIST digit classification project achieving >98% accuracy

## Weekly Structure

- **Day 6**: Neural Network Theory and Forward Propagation
- **Day 7**: Backpropagation and Training
- **Day 8**: Introduction to PyTorch
- **Day 9**: Building Neural Networks in PyTorch
- **Day 10**: MNIST Project - Digit Classification

## Key Resources

**Videos:** 3Blue1Brown (primary), StatQuest (supporting), PyTorch tutorials (practical)
**Text:** Dive into Deep Learning Chapter 5, PyTorch documentation

## Tips for Success

- Watch 3Blue1Brown videos actively - pause and predict
- Implement from scratch before using PyTorch (Days 6-7)
- Type code, don't copy-paste
- Debug systematically - check shapes and gradients
- Complete daily reflections
